# Video Files for Building View Background

To add the video background for the condominium registration page, please add the following video files to this directory:

## Required Files:
- `building-view.mp4` - Main video file (MP4 format)
- `building-view.webm` - WebM format for better browser compatibility (optional)

## Video Specifications:
- **Content**: A video showing a city skyline with modern high-rise buildings
- **Duration**: 10-30 seconds (looping)
- **Resolution**: 1920x1080 or higher
- **Format**: MP4 (H.264) and WebM
- **Size**: Optimize for web (under 10MB recommended)

## Fallback:
If no video files are present, the page will automatically fall back to using the static image `/images/hero-bg.png`.

## Example Video Sources:
- Stock video websites (Shutterstock, iStock, etc.)
- Free stock video sites (Pexels, Pixabay, etc.)
- Custom footage of city buildings

## Notes:
- The video will autoplay, loop, and be muted for better user experience
- Mobile devices may not support autoplay, so the fallback image is important
- The video has a dark overlay (60% black) applied for better text readability
